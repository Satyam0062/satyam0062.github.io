Hi, I am Satyam, a third-year undergraduate in Electrical Engineering at National
Institute of Technology Agartala. I started learning Data Science in May 2019,
took an advanced course and completed the course in December 2019. I did an
internship at Ignitus where I developed educational content on a few topics of
Machine Learning. I have just finished my internship at Inscripta.ai where I
created a model to generate relevant questions from the user and professional
reviews. My core area of interest is Natural Language Processing and Computer
Vision. I love solving problems and push myself to learn something new from
every problem.

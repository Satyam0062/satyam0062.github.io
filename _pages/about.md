Hi, I am Satyam, a third-year undergraduate in Electrical Engineering at National
Institute of Technology Agartala. I started learning Data Science in May 2019,
took an advanced course and completed the course in December 2019. I did an
internship at Ignitus where I developed educational content on a few topics of
Machine Learning. I have just finished my internship at Inscripta.ai where I
created a model to generate relevant questions from the user and professional
reviews. My core area of interest is Natural Language Processing and Computer
Vision. I love solving problems and push myself to learn something new from
every problem.

## Experience
1. **Machine Learning intern at Ignitus**
* Collaborated in the development of MOOC on the concepts of Machine learning.
* Created new content on programming in python.
* Corrected the existing errors in the course.


2. **Data Science intern at Inscripta.ai**
* The main aim was to generate relevant questions from the user and professional reviews.
* Developed 3 models - the first model selects important sentences from user and
professional reviews using Named Entity recognition, Second model searches for
answers of some standard questions from the important sentences, the third model
generates questions around the important sentences.
* Combined the three models to get relevant questions and answers.
